I'm very glad that you see my project!

The main reason for the creation of this project is to find and classify the skills and technologies used in the work of a Data Analyst/Scientist.

The project consists of several files:
'Data Collecting' - Gathering job postings through API
'Data Cleaning' - Cleaning and processing the previously gathered data
'Data Printing' - Counting data and creating charts
'chart' folder - Saved charts
'Counter - tables' folder - tables with counted data
Two Tableau Dashboards as JPGs, below are a links to the charts:
