7,Senior Data Scientist,Frontiers,Anywhere,via LinkedIn,"We are on a mission to make science open so everyone can live healthy lives on a healthy planet

Who We Are

Frontiers is an award-winning open science platform and leading open access scholarly publisher.

We are one of the largest and most cited publishers globally. To date, our 200,000 freely available research articles have received more than 1 billion views and downloads and 2 million citations. Our journals span science, health, humanities and social sciences, engineering, and sustainability. And we continue to expand into new academic disciplines so more researchers can publish open access.

Be part of the publishing revolution and help us transform the way research is published, evaluated, and communicated to the world.

About the opportunity:

Frontiers catalog is growing. Every month we need to handle more journals, articles, and research topics, to process more data and enable new features for our users.

We are looking for an enthusiastic and hands-on Data Scientist to... help us to empower Frontiers with highly precise data, suggestions and predictions. You’ll also help us tackle complex problems and produce solutions that will propel open science forward.

The role will involve working with data at scale built from several external and internal sources and applying Data Science models to it. We are therefore looking for talented individuals who have hands-on experience in designing data-intensive applications and big data solutions with a good knowledge of all types of data storage.

Tech Stack & Key Requirements:
• Experience with python development.
• Experience working with classifiers that scale well with a large number of samples (e.g. approximate kNN).
• Experience working with Natural Language Processing (text classification, word & sentence embeddings, name entity recognition)
• Knowledge of NLP libraries (NLTK, SpaCy)
• Knowledge of clustering algorithms that scale well with large numbers of samples (e.g. minibatch K-means, OPTICS, BIRCH).
• Knowledge of recommender systems (e.g. Matrix factorization).
• Expertise in the processing of large datasets (e.g. via Spark, Azure Databricks) using large-data storage (e.g. Parquet on Azure blob storage, Databricks Delta).
• Ability to prioritize
• Experience working in a team environment.
• Familiarity with Agile framework
• Good English skills

Your Main responsibilities:
• Design, implement, monitor, and optimize our data platforms storing key information to power our internal recommender systems and other ML pipelines
• Understand functional requirements for defining the Data science tools to solve the problem at hand.
• Collaborate closely with Machine Learning and Data Science Teams in order tackle larger problems.

Challenges you will face:
• Apply Machine Learning and NLP methods to extract out specific tokens from unstructured text belonging to specific categories such as author names, organization names, geographical location.
• Creating models that can tell apart authors with similar names (author disambiguation)
• Creating models that are able to classify research papers.
• Evaluating our pipelines and coming up with ways to improve their performance.

Benefits

With more than 50 nationalities represented in our global team, you will work regularly with teammates in other countries, and with our community of researchers, editors, and authors from around the globe.

Our mission to create solutions for healthy lives also extends to the working environment we provide for our employees.

This includes:

100% remote working

Employees now have the flexibility to choose where they want to work, with remote working available on a part- or full-time basis (not applicable to some Workplace/IT jobs due to nature of role requiring presence onsite, in the office).

Learning and development

All employees have access to LinkedIn Learning (and Pluralsight for our technology team), an annual personal learning budget, and dedicated L&D time.

Wellbeing

We offer free online yoga classes, an employee assistance plan, access to the Headspace app, and four wellbeing days on top of your annual leave allowance.

Volunteering opportunities

Employees can dedicate three days each year to volunteer for a personal cause or through our volunteering partner platform, Alaya.

Frontiers actively embraces diversity and is a safe and welcoming workplace. Recruitment is free from discrimination – including based on race, national or ethnic origin, age, religion, disability, sex, gender identity or sexual orientation. With over 600 employees from more than 50 different nations, our diversity creates vibrant teams and constantly challenges us to appreciate multiple perspectives","['5 hours ago', 'Work from home', 'Full-time']","{'posted_at': '5 hours ago', 'schedule_type': 'Full-time', 'work_from_home': True}",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,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR_8gpUZX4e8-8JgY2H_GiSw0K4ERAFo5SFw2--9CI&s
