Product Madness is so much more than just a Pool table and a foosball game.

We believe in an honest and transparent approach with our teammates. Company wide weekly Town Halls, All Hands and strategy meetings are just a few ways in which we encourage an open and honest path to achieving complete transparency.

Despite a pandemic, there isn’t a day where we don’t feel connected to one another.

With frequent events, workshops, giveaways, slack coffee and donut sessions we have definitely brought on our office culture to this new virtual world of zoom calls.

We also try to cater for all our staff’s needs – be that a freshly brewed cappuccino made by our professional barista in our free coffee shop or by providing a bountiful supply of tasty snacks to keep us refueled and buzzing.

We love to organise plenty of social get-togethers and action-packed activity days, be it slipping inside an inflatable bumper ball for a mad session of football zorbing or throwing caution to the wind and traversing giddy treetop rope courses at Go Ape. On top of these team-building activities, our lunch and learn workshops, not to mention the lavish Christmas and summer parties, foster that ‘work hard, play hard’ mantra. Our offices are based in the heart of the metropolises of London and Lviv, surrounded by an abundance of diversity and inspiration to keep those ideas flowing.

Our Values
• People First

We have the deepest respect for our people and their well being. We know they are exceptionally talented and will always have a choice. We want them to re-choose us every day. We are committed to building a culture where each person's voice will always be heard and addressed.
• MAD for More

Always improving, innovating and never settling for the existing. We push all boundaries with courage and ambition to become the world’s best games company.
• Champion Together We excel at what we do but yet remain humble and helpful to our teammates. We champion one another and hold each other to high standards without any egos.
• Globally Inclusive

We are all Equal - regardless of the language we speak, where we live, our gender, religion or culture we come from. We want to build a global home, where everyone has the equal opportunity to make an impact.
• Customer Focused

We always think from the customer's perspective - be it players or internal customers.

Improving their experience and joy is what drives us. Every client's success is our big win!
