• #WeAreCisco. We are all unique, but collectively we bring our talents to work as a team, to develop innovative technology and power a more inclusive, digital future for everyone. How do we do it? Well, for starters – with people like you!

Nearly every internet connection around the world touches Cisco. We’re the Internet’s optimists. Our technology makes sure the data travelling at light speed across connections does so securely, yet it’s not what we make but what we make happen which marks us out. We’re helping those who work in the health service to connect with patients and each other; schools, colleges and universities to teach in even the most challenging of times. We’re helping businesses of all shapes and size to connect with their employees and customers in new ways, providing people with access to the digital skills they need and connecting the most remote parts of the world – whether through 5G, or otherwise.

We tackle whatever challenges come our way. We have each other’s backs, we recognize our accomplishments, and we grow together. We celebrate and support one another – from big and small things in life to big career moments. And giving back is in our DNA (we get 10 days off each year to do just that).

We know that powering an inclusive future starts with us. Because without diversity and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. Our 30 Inclusive Communities, that bring people together around commonalities or passions, are leading the way. Together we’re committed to learning, listening, caring for our communities, whilst supporting the most vulnerable with a collective effort to make this world a better place either with technology, or through our actions.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing?

At DSV ISS we offer local and global IT positions in a rewarding and challenging environment. DSV Global IT is accountable for the strategy, system architecture, development and day-to-day operation & support for our global infrastructure and business applications. At every IT position at DSV ISS you have a real influence and a chance to produce visible results.

Do you want to push the boundaries of machine learning and scale it to users across the world? Do you wish for a product centric work environment, where machine learning and analytics drive action – not just insight?

With a strong focus on the MLOps discipline you will take part in the innovation and design of new products, as well as tweak and mature existing ones. You will join a small team of highly talented data scientists and collaborate with several... product teams consisting of product owners, backend- and frontend developers and DevSecOps specialists. You will be responsible for a product agnostic guild of data scientists and ML engineers, aiming to create and continuously enhance the ML framework of tomorrow.

Join a department focused on our most valuable digital products

You will join the Digital Enterprise Transformation department. The purpose of our department is to build advanced end-to-end products which create direct business value for DSV’s divisions, including:
• Customs declaration automation
• Vendor invoices automation
• Booking distribution
• Address validation
• ETA prediction

The use cases we solve tend to have a high degree of complexity, requiring non-deterministic problem solving (i.e., the use of ML/AI), near real-time data processing, a need for high availability, vertical and horizontal scalability, and a very high volume of transactions.

Our new unit is characterized by having a startup mindset, and it is divided into cross-functional product teams with a mix of career starters and highly experienced colleagues. We strive to base our work on knowledge and insight rather than hierarchical structures, and we make sure that our decisions are based on conversations between people with different competencies rather than one individual.

Your responsibilities:

Be the driver of our AI/ML and analytics journey

As our next Senior Data Scientist, you will use the right tools in the toolbox to solve the issues at hand. You will want to get your hands dirty with our MLOps platforms, as well as designing, implementing, and enhancing the following areas of our Machine Learning practices:
• Meeting with stakeholders, discussing their needs and translating them into Data Science problems.
• Conduct data-driven analyses to provide input to decisions (e.g. which DSV country to start with for a specific use case).
• Identifying proper solutions / models / pre-trained models for particular business cases.
• Preprocessing the data (cleaning, transforming) for ML models.
• Train ML models on prepared training data using GPU on cloud and on premises.
• Test and evaluate ML models and present conclusions on further improvements.
• Using and tweaking existing frameworks for running automated testing and evaluation of ML models.
• Maturing models to be available as services for other components.
• Present your results on an ongoing basis to team mates and business stakeholders.

You thrive when solving high-complexity challenges

Solving problems too complex for deterministic reasoning with the use of machine learning, you need to be able to thoroughly analyze problems using data and statistics. With these skills, you make realistic mockups of data to allow you to test things swiftly, finding pragmatic solutions that balance between the theoretical standpoint and what is possible.

Our requirements:
• Code languages: Python (using both OOP as well as popular libraries such as Pandas, Scikit),
• Solid understanding of Machine Learning in practice : be able to speak about several projects you participated in,
• Very good knowledge of Deep Learning with focus on NLP: Transformers, Bert family and where it all came from,
• MLOps frameworks: Google Vertex AI & Kubeflow are the core of our MLOps platform. Furthermore, we expect that you have substantial experience with other MLOps (AWS, Azure, other) solutions and you can challenge our ways of working.
• Cloud architecture: Azure
• ML Frameworks: PyTorch & TensorFlow
• ML model serving: TorchServe & TensorFlow Serving
• Coding languages: Python & Java
• Database technologies such as: MySQL & MongoDB
• Version control: Git, DVC, Azure DevOps
