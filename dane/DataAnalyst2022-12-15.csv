• Present results back to the business in a structured, data-driven manner - simplifying complex concepts for non-technical audiences
• Set and improve on analytical best practices in our team and in the wider business

What we’re looking for from you
• Experience in an analytics or data science role. Experience in a fintech or fast-growing data-driven B2C companies would be a bonus but not essential.

• Strong SQL skills, able to handle large, complex data structures from multiple sources
• Strong Storytelling skills using a range of mediums (documents, presentations, verbal)
• Experience with using other coding languages (e.g. R, Python) to analyse complex datasets
• Understanding of the fundamentals of Data Architecture, Governance and Quality
