Kontakt.io Virtues and Culture

Lead customer-centric - customer leadership is the key. If a customer has a problem we don’t wait. We understand what customer needs and we tailor our services, products around the customer. It doesn’t mean that we let the customer lead us. It means that we think about the customer first

Have a growth mindset - we commit to results and growth. We are responsible for results, not for the activity or time spent. If we believe we can’t achieve a result or a job, it’s our duty to raise the voice, push back, explain what we suggest instead. We don’t see results as something static - ever. This means that our results and expectations are becoming more ambitious, quarter over quarter. We constantly evolve

Challenge, inspire, respect - we are the challenger in the marketplace. When working with each other - or with customers - we enjoy and desire to challenge each other. We listen, reflect, and respond. We aim to understand the point of view of the other party and if there is customer merit in the argument. When we challenge, we articulate our hypothesis clearly and provide data and evidence in our argumentation. We respect the time of our colleagues. We have a zero-tolerance towards discrimination of any kind. We respect the environment

Execute systematically - We recognize that the start-up journey will only be successful if we learn twice as much as others in half the time. For us, innovation also means continuous improvement in all fields. We think in systems when driving results, growth, and learnings

Act with urgency - We have a sense of urgency in everything we do - at all times. It’s deeply rooted in the belief that as an up-start, as a challenger, we need to drive value for our customers faster and better than anybody else in the marketplace. We do things outside of the personal comfort zone","[{'link': 'http://kontakt.io/', 'text': 'kontakt.io'}, {'link': 'https://www.google.com/search?q=Kontakt.io&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjY1_TW1db8AhXYM1kFHT3zBdMQmJACCN4K', 'text': 'See web results for Kontakt.io'}]",https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTM_UbeDMFKU6SYXMlRAN9HncLKbANZoRsu8P8m3AY&s,"['21 hours ago', 'Work from home', 'Full-time']","{'posted_at': '21 hours ago', 'schedule_type': 'Full-time', 'work_from_home': True}",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

• Stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in data engineering

What do we do?

BIMobject.com is a platform where we connect manufacturers of building materials with architects and engineers so they can work on building projects together. BIM enables more efficient processes in the project pipeline leading to less costs, less waste and fewer delays. Getting access to all the BIM content on our site helps the construction industry to build right from the start while giving support in finding environmentally sound products.

What we offer our employees

BIMobject is a company founded in 2011 and headquartered in Malmö, Sweden, with colleagues all over the world: Malmö, Budapest, Madrid, Gliwice, Milan, Munich and on. We value our cultural diversity and the many perspectives our employees bring. For those interested, we offer the opportunity to live and work abroad. However, as we speak 16+ languages at the Malmö HQ, you don't have to go far to get the international vibe.

The start-up mentality is an important part of us, meaning that we never want to stop experimenting and learning and we love to see our people grow. We prioritise continuous personal development by investing in our engaged employees. Finally and maybe most importantly, we want all our employees to have the possibility to shape their work and have their say in how we drive our company forward.

We are proud to foster a workplace free from discrimination. We strongly believe that diversity of experience, perspectives, and background will lead to a better environment for our employees and a better product for our users and our customers. This is something we value deeply and we encourage everyone to come be a part of changing the way the industry works.

Practical information

We are a remote-friendly company and operate in a hybrid work model. Your team will be located mainly in Malmö, Stockholm and Budapest and we would love it if you live close to any of those locations - we value the flexibility in being able to meet part of the team quite easily.
