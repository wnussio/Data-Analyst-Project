Description of the cluster:

CORE is an acronym for COmmerzbank Related Entities. CORE is a group wide static/master data application of Commerzbank AG which focus on person, organisation an group views. CORE comprises in different modules like CORE Person, CORE GlobalParty & Verbund and CORE Admin.

The importance of person, organisation and group view has grown significantly in the last years because of regulatory requirements and from the sales point of view. It is therefore an integral part of our business model.

The missing comprehensive person, organisation and group views in the Commerzbank group, has been compensated with single applications and predominant manual workarounds.

Because of new and existing regulatory requirements (i.e. tax requirements, granting of exemption applications, transfer of church tax, FATCA, Basel II and III, etc) it has been decided to incrementally rebuild the person, organisation and group views within CORE.
